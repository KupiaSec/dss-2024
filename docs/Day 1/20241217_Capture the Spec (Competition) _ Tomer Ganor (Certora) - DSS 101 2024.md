# Capture the Spec (Competition) | Tomer Ganor (Certora) - DSS 101 2024

This YouTube video summarizes a competition related to smart contract development, specifically within the context of the Decentralized Solutions Summit (DSS) 101 2024. Tomer Ganor, from Certora, discusses the competition and its requirements.

## 1. Main Points

* **Competition Overview**: The competition focuses on developing a smart contract that adheres to a pre-defined specification ("Capture the Spec").
* **DSS Context**: The competition is a part of the larger Decentralized Solutions Summit, likely providing an educational and practical element.
* **Solidity Emphasis**:  Participants are creating Solidity smart contracts.
* **Specification Provided**: The video emphasizes the importance of understanding and adhering to the provided specifications.
* **Multisig Emphasis**: The contract in question appears to be designed for a multisig setup.
* **Detailed Requirements**: The smart contract needs to have specific components, properties, and functional guidelines outlined in the specification.
* **Problem-Solving Focus**:  The speaker encourages problem-solving and focuses on the need to understand and correctly implement the specifications.
* **Efficiency and Security**:  Important aspects to consider in the development process are efficiency and security.  Code should meet the criteria of the specification, not deviate from it and bugs, or inefficiencies, need to be avoided.
* **Resources Provided**: Participants are given a repository to use for building their smart contracts.
* **Further Assistance**: Speakers mentioned a telegram channel and specific links for resources and information about the competition.


## 2. Key Insights

* **Crucial Role of Specifications**:  The speaker strongly emphasizes that understanding and accurately implementing the contract specification is critical to success in the competition.  Deviation leads to failure to meet the criteria.
* **Importance of Multisig Contracts**:  The focus on multisig in the specified contract suggests it needs various parties' approval or signatures for transactions.
* **Focus on Invariants**: The video highlights the importance of invariants—constraints that should always hold true within the smart contract—and provides crucial rules for design and code.
* **Process Over Just Complicated Code**:  The process for creating, testing, and checking a smart contract is emphasized over just getting the smart contract working correctly. Getting a working contract is important but the speaker stressed the importance of method and process by which this problem was approached.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Thoroughly Understand Specifications**: Before starting any development, thoroughly read and analyze the given specifications.
* **Document Every Step**: Document your decisions regarding implementation and design. This enables participants to easily troubleshoot issues, and to review their process in a way that can be understood.
* **Testing and Verification**: Rigorous and methodical testing is key to ensuring the contract matches the given specification.
* **Communicate and Seek Help**: The speaker's encouragement to ask questions and utilize resources (telegram channel, etc.) is vital. This reinforces the importance of learning and the value of community/professional assistance when problems occur.


## 4. Additional Notes

* The video presentation appears to be a summary of a competition, rather than a detailed step-by-step tutorial.  The speaker assumes a general level of knowledge about smart contracts and Solidity.
* The audio is slightly difficult to understand in parts; note-taking during the presentation is likely an important way to fully grasp the details.
* Due to the transcript issues, this summary is a helpful but highly simplified version and participants would need to review the video for full details and nuances.
