## What your auditor REALLY thinks but is afraid to tell you... (YouTube Video Summary)

This video, likely a panel discussion, delves into the *real* thoughts of auditors regarding the clients they audit.  The discussion, presented in a somewhat informal, conversational style, highlights several crucial aspects.

**1. Main Points (bullet points)**

* **Underlying Business Concerns:**  Auditors often perceive a disconnect between what clients say and what they *actually* do. They focus on underlying business issues and not just the technical details of code.
* **Importance of Business Relationships:**  Audited businesses are often perceived as having a business relationship, and thus, auditors need to be mindful of the underlying factors that affect the relationship, independent of the security aspect.
* **Insufficient Testing:**  Many clients, especially in the burgeoning Web3 space, don't perform adequate testing, relying on external security providers to validate aspects of the project.
* **Inadequate Consideration of Security:**  There's a perception that security is often viewed as an afterthought, rather than a foundational element early in the development phase.
* **Over-reliance on External Auditing:**  Clients may over-depend on external security providers to address security concerns.
* **Limitations of Auditing:** The discussion emphasizes that auditors aren't necessarily testers.  Audits don't guarantee absolute security; there are limitations to the value of external assurance.
* **Managing Expectations:** Auditors highlight the importance of managing client expectations for what auditing can and cannot deliver, which can be challenging for both parties.
* **Emphasis on Early Feedback:**  The conversation stresses the benefits of receiving feedback early in the development lifecycle to prevent costly errors and vulnerabilities needing fixing later.
* **Commercial Considerations:**  Auditors note commercial pressures often take priority over robust security procedures, especially when deadlines loom.


**2. Key Insights (detailed explanations)**

* **The Core Issue is Not Just Code:** The discussion moves beyond simple technical flaws in code to a broader understanding of corporate culture, business operations, and the motivations behind project decisions, particularly in the face of commercial expediency.
* **Ownership of Security:** There is a shared responsibility for security between the client team and the auditor.  Auditors don't own the security; the client does, and their understanding of risk often dictates the choices, and the security posture, of the protocol.
* **Importance of Deep Engagement:**  The video underlines the need for extensive involvement of the client team throughout the entire project lifecycle to achieve optimal security posture.



**3. Practical Takeaways (actionable items)**

* **Proactive Security:**  Ensure security is considered throughout the development life cycle, not an afterthought.
* **Independent Assurance:** Auditors need to be *independent* and provide rigorous scrutiny, and clients should ask for recommendations.
* **Early Bug Reporting:** Encouraging and accepting early feedback on the project design and implementation.
* **Focus on Processes:** Instead of solely focusing on code testing, prioritize building a solid security-conscious culture and processes.
* **Legal Considerations:**  Understand the role of NDAs and other legal agreements as necessary safeguards for security-sensitive information within the company.
* **Honest Communication:**  Clients need to be open and honest regarding the project's security, and auditors must deliver clear expectations.



**4. Additional Notes (if any)**

* **Contextual Understanding:** The discussion highlights the significance of understanding the overall context and specific circumstances of each project when assessing security.   This can differ based on the industry and even the exact type of protocol being audited.
* **No Magic Bullets:** The video stresses that there are no easy answers or guaranteed solutions to software security problems in the Web3 space.  Finding a safe deployment path often involves a delicate balance.
* **Emphasis on Testing:** The panelists emphasize the importance of a robust and comprehensive test suite, including unit testing, integration testing and end-to end testing, alongside manual reviews.
* **Collaboration Is Key:**  The conversation repeatedly stresses the need for collaboration and transparency between auditors and clients to ensure a secure outcome for both parties.


This summary provides a high-level overview.  Specific details are difficult without significant context (e.g. the exact protocols or projects discussed).
