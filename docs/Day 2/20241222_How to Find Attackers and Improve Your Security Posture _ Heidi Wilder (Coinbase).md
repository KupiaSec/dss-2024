# How to Find Attackers and Improve Your Security Posture | Heidi Wilder (Coinbase) - Summary

This YouTube video, by Heidi Wilder from Coinbase, focuses on identifying attackers and improving security posture in blockchain and cryptocurrency environments.

## 1. Main Points

* **Identifying Attackers:** The primary focus is on techniques for identifying malicious actors in the blockchain space.
* **Contract Analysis:**  Thorough analysis of smart contracts to uncover vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors.
* **Funds Tracing:** Tracing the flow of funds to determine the origins of suspicious activity and identify the attacker.
* **Source Intelligence:** Using various tools to gather information about potential attackers and their activities.
* **Case Studies:** The video uses specific case studies of past attacks to illustrate the techniques and highlight common patterns.
* **ENT (Entity) Analysis:** Analysis of entities associated with the attacker's activity.
* **Off-Chain Activity:**  Investigation into off-chain activities related to the attack.
* **Security Improvement:**  Techniques and resources are provided to improve security postures.

## 2. Key Insights

* **Attacker Profiling:** Attackers often exhibit predictable patterns in their strategies and behavior, such as early adoption, use of particular tools, or connections with other malicious actors. Identifying these trends can help predict future attacks.
* **Combined Research Methods:** The most effective approach involves combining multiple research methods, such as contract analysis, funds tracing, and source intelligence gathering to create a comprehensive picture of the attacker's activities.
* **Open Source Tools:**  Leveraging available open-source tools like Dune Analytics for data analysis significantly enhances investigation efficiency and speed.
* **Importance of Case Studies:** Understanding how past attacks were executed provides vital insights into how future attacks might unfold and proactive measures to mitigate them.
* **Network Connections:** Investigating links between wallets, addresses, and entities connected to the attacker provides critical information.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Implement thorough contract audits:**  Engage reputable firms to perform rigorous smart contract audits to proactively identify vulnerabilities before an attack.
* **Continuously Monitor Transactions:** Implement tools for real-time monitoring of transactions, especially from known or suspicious addresses, to detect unusual activity.
* **Analyze Network Structures:** Utilize blockchain explorers and other tools to analyze the network structures and identify connections related to fraudulent activity.
* **Continuous Learning:** Keep abreast of the latest attack techniques and tools by following industry experts, engaging in communities, and participating in relevant courses to stay ahead of evolving threats.
* **Use available resources:** Leverage publicly available tools and communities (like Dune Analytics) to aid in analysis and investigations.

## 4. Additional Notes

* The presentation's time constraints mean that the speaker doesn't go into exhaustive detail.  The key takeaway is that thorough detective-style investigation involves many tools and techniques (funds tracing, open source intel, case studies).
* The video is focused on the *how* of finding and identifying attackers; it doesn't detail the *solutions* for preventing these attacks, such as security protocols or smart contract architecture improvements.
* The emphasis on case studies is valuable in exposing the methodology and patterns used by cybercriminals, helping those in security roles to learn from past incidents and gain foresight into potential future activities.
