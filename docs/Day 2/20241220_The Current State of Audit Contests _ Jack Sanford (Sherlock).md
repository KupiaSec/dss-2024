# The Current State of Audit Contests | Jack Sanford (Sherlock) - Summary

This YouTube video summarizes the current state of audit contests in the cryptocurrency space, particularly highlighting the recent trends and developments.

## 1. Main Points

* **Audit Contests are thriving:** The speaker presents significant data showing a substantial increase in the number of audit contests, participants, and rewards.
* **Two types of audit contests:** The video distinguishes between open and closed contests, discussing their key differences and implications for security researchers.
* **The growth of security research:** The trend suggests a significant increase in security researchers participating, indicating a burgeoning industry.
* **Fixed vs. Variable rewards:**  The speaker notes the change from fixed-price bounties to variable payouts, especially on high-severity vulnerabilities. This is a shift from traditional audit models.
* **Increased emphasis on critical vulnerabilities:** There's a clear trend towards focusing on finding and rewarding critical vulnerabilities instead of lower-level ones.
* **Variability and flexibility:** The video stresses the growing variation and flexibility in contest design, contest length, and participant compensation.
* **The growing maturity of the space:** The increased professionalism, professionalism, and sophistication of both contests and the researchers involved suggest a more mature crypto security landscape.

## 2. Key Insights

The speaker, Jack Sanford, presents a nuanced view of the current audit contest landscape in crypto.  He emphasizes that:

* **Open contests are very active.**  This open model allows for a broader base of participation, but also creates greater challenges in distinguishing truly meaningful vulnerabilities.
* **Professionalization of security researchers:**  The video highlights the substantial pay and opportunities available, attracting highly skilled professionals who bring greater expertise and skill.
* **Fixed-pay models are less common:**  The traditional fixed-amount models are less frequently utilized in favor of dynamic compensation tied to the vulnerability's criticality, meaning the rewards might be less certain.
* **Emphasis on quality assurance:** Protocol teams are effectively utilizing audits to enhance the safety and security of their protocols prior to mainnet deployment, indicating a shift towards proactive safety measures.
* **AI involvement is a possibility:** The speaker suggests that AI tools might potentially impact the nature and quantity of submissions, with potential further developments and sophistication in the future.

## 3. Practical Takeaways

* **Stay updated on emerging trends:** Security researchers need to keep up with the evolving structure and features of audit contests.
* **Focus on critical bugs:** Prioritizing and correctly classifying vulnerabilities will enhance your value to protocol teams.
* **Develop AI skills:** Understanding the potential for AI-driven submissions and vulnerabilities is important for future preparedness.
* **Understand the variability of paid audits:**  The more dynamic structure of rewards will likely persist in the coming months. Be prepared for different compensation methods.
* **Networking within the space:**  The growing number of participants suggests the value of networking and community building to advance one's position and explore opportunities.
* **Thoroughness and Quality are key:** Highlighting the challenges of discernment with lots of submissions, it emphasizes the importance of thorough review and critical analysis when evaluating audit reports.


## 4. Additional Notes

The video's strengths lie in its comprehensive data analysis of the changing audit contest ecosystem.  It highlights valuable insights into how security researchers are adapting to the evolving marketplace of crypto protocol security.
