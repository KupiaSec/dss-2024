# Enhancing Protocol Security With ZK-Oracles | Victor Petrenko (Lido), Eugene Kolpakov

This video discusses enhancing protocol security using zero-knowledge (ZK) oracles.

## 1. Main Points

*   Introduction to the problem of incorporating external data into blockchain protocols.
*   Discussion of the security risks associated with external data.
*   Explanation of the use of ZK-Oracles to minimize trust and increase security.
*   Technical details of the specific implementation used in the Lido protocol.
*   Explanation of the ZK-Oracle framework's advantages over traditional methods.
*   Detailed explanation of the accounting oracles' function and the verification committee.
*   Comparison of different implementations and their limitations.
*   Discussion of potential attack vectors and mitigation techniques.
*   Summary of the proposal's strengths and weaknesses.
*   Presentation of the implications for the future development and enhancement of the protocol.

## 2. Key Insights

The central insight is that incorporating external data into blockchain protocols introduces significant security vulnerabilities.  Traditional methods rely on trusted sources, which are susceptible to manipulation.  ZK-Oracles offer a solution to this by providing verifiable proofs of the external data without revealing the data itself to the blockchain network.  This dramatically reduces the risks associated with a single point of failure or manipulation, enhancing the overall security of the system.  The speakers highlighted the technical complexity and potential trade-offs in adopting this approach. The key benefits highlighted are:

* **Reduced Trust:** Zero-knowledge proofs reduce the need for trusting a single entity, which significantly improves the layer's security.
* **Increased Transparency:** While data remains confidential, the data's integrity is verified, increasing transparency for the protocol users.
* **Scalability:** The ZK-Oracle approach is potentially more scalable than other methods.


## 3. Practical Takeaways

*   Understand the concept of ZK-proofs and their application to blockchain security.
*   Study how external data integration can compromise blockchain security, and identify possible vulnerabilities.
*   Consider the potential cost of verifying external data and the trade-offs associated with different zero-knowledge implementations. 
*   Develop a strong understanding of blockchain protocol architecture and the role of oracles within it.


## 4. Additional Notes

The video is dense with technical details.  It assumes a significant prior knowledge of blockchain development and ZK-proof theory.  The presenters highlight an improved approach with a more cost-effective method for using external data by reducing the reliance on numerous individual oracles, opting instead for a consensus-based method.  However, there are still possible risks/constraints to this approach, such as the need to verify that the reported data accurately reflects the conditions in reality. The speakers suggest that the most promising future improvements focus on broader adoption and community collaboration to improve the implementation.
