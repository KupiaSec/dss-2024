# AI-Driven Prevention of Malicious Blockchain Transactions | Carlos Salort Sanchez (Forta)

This is a summary of the YouTube video.

1. **Main Points**
    * Forta uses AI to detect malicious blockchain transactions.
    * Forta's AI system analyzes patterns in blockchain activity to identify suspicious behavior.
    * The system uses a stateless approach, meaning it does not rely on past data to make predictions, instead it directly analyzes the transaction itself.
    * Forta's AI flags suspicious activity and prevents the malicious transactions before they happen, or alerts users before they incur into losses.
    * The presenters explain the importance of AI in blockchain security and the effectiveness of Forta's approach.
    * The AI algorithm learns from the patterns in blockchain activity by detecting false positives to minimize the impact on legitimate users.

2. **Key Insights**
    * **Stateless Approach:** Forta's AI distinguishes itself by using a stateless approach. This means that it does not need access to past blockchain data or a full blockchain history, leading to a faster processing time.  The algorithm examines each transaction in isolation, looking for anomalies and characteristics indicative of malicious activity. This is a significant advantage over traditional methods that require extensive past transaction history.

    * **AI-Powered Transaction Screening:** The system isn't simply identifying known bad actors; it's proactively identifying potentially malicious transactions in real-time.  The key is their usage of AI to establish a predictive model to anticipate threats and flag them before they compromise the blockchain.

    * **Practical Application:** The system has demonstrated success in proactively preventing significant malicious activity (in the case study, they prevented a potential $40 million loss), highlighting the valuable contribution of proactive AI screening.

    * **Continuous Improvement:** The presenters emphasize that blockchain security is an iterative process of refining AI models to improve accuracy over time as well as a broader concern for system quality as a whole. Continuous learning from detected false positives and adjusting the algorithms ensures the AI model remains accurate and effective in the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain attacks.

3. **Practical Takeaways**
    * Machine learning is a crucial part of modern blockchain security.
    * Using AI in blockchain analysis allows for faster and potentially more accurate detection of malicious activities.
    * Employing a stateless approach to blockchain transaction screening can enhance speed and reduce the impact on legitimate users.
    * Continuously monitoring and training AI models is essential for maintaining their effectiveness against rapidly evolving attack methods.
    * Understanding the trade-off between stopping attacks and impeding legitimate operations is necessary when implementing these systems.  A good evaluation of various scenarios will help to establish the right threshold for intervention.


4. **Additional Notes**
    * The speaker provides a detailed overview of the underlying machine-learning models and their application to blockchain analysis. There is a focus on the practical aspects and implications of the Forta solutionâ€”such as identifying likely false positives and handling large dataset sizes.
    * The presentation appears to be part of a larger blockchain security strategy at the company. Some examples of security approaches are alluded to (like firewalls).
    * The audio quality and speech pacing could use minor adjustments to be more consistent during certain segments. A clear understanding of the concepts is still conveyed.
